		<h4>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Finally something that works</h4>
		So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn't making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn't have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!<br>

		<h4>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Only Plug-in that worked</h4>
		I used a lot of high ranking plug-ins but they still broke my design. Downloaded this and worked right away. Thanks!<br>
